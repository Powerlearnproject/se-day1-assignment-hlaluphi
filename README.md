#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a process of modeling a software by systimatically applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software involving all Software Develpment Life Sycle phases.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The development of Programing Languages
2. Software engineering was established as a dicipline during the 1960's
3. Agile methodology was formed, implemented and gain pupularity during the 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: This Phase requires you to collect information by doing research about the app that  you want to create and how is it going to benefit the user and also which system and tools are required.
2. Design: Design user interface (eg using figma) just to have a blue print of how the app is going to look in a more detailed manner including the architectue.
3. Implementation: Start Coding following the blueprint or specifics of your design .
4. Testing: Test all your software's functionalities and features to ensure that they all function as they are intended and that they meet all required quality standards.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software.
6. Maintenance: Keep the software up to date and constantly make required changes and improvements in future.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is a flexible methodology that is suitable for a Software with evolving requirements eg a Social Media Platform whereas Waterfall methodology is sequential and structured in a manner that requires a step-by-step approach where each step must be completed before advancing to the next step with unchanging requirements 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs enables you to write, test and debug your codes using their tools with libraries, plugins, extentions in one place. eg VSCode(Visual Studio)
VCS helps in tracking changes to source code and understanding the evolution of the project also allows Developers/team members to collaborate/work on the same project simultaneously eg Git(Github)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements: they can be overcomed by applying Agile methodologies which will ensure project's flexibility to any changes that may occur.
Tight deadlines: they can be overcomed by prioritizing tasks and seting project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit Testing : testing a software unit by unit ensuring that each unit is tested.
- Intergration Testing: testing softwsre's interaction between different components and subsystems.
- System Testing: thesting the whole system of the software.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software to ensure that it meets all user needs.
These tests are important in software quality assurance because they ensure that all issues/defects within the software can be determined and be fixed in early stages of development to mantain/keep the software version at a high-quality level as per all requirements. 

 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering refers to how you ask question in a manner that enables AI to give you a better answer that is Structured in a way that suits your context. Interacting with AI Models enables us to function effitiently without exhausing ourselves by letting AI handle repitative tasks(since well computers do not get tired of running repetative tasks) while we focus on solving other problems, creativity and other aspects of our lives. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt : "write an article on how did Inter Miami FC perfom during 2023/2024 season"

Improved Prompt: "as a newspaper witer and a sports jounalist you are required to write a Sports news article, write an article on how did Inter Miami FC perfom during 2023/2024 season. Make the article fun to read to Inter Miami FC's Supporter and include Lionel Messi's key moments"

The improved Prompt is more effective because it is more specific, Clear and concise by specifyin a role as a "Newspaper writer and Sports Journalist" and Clear by mentioning the type of an article which is a "sports news article", followed by: "write an article on how did Inter Miami FC perfom during 2023/2024 season" and then a Context as "Make the article fun to read to Inter Miami FC's Supporter and include Lionel Messi's key moments". this helps AI understand my request better and also esures that i will get the best results that suits my Context.
